module Startback
  #
  # High-level Operation abstraction, that is a piece of code that executes
  # on demand and (generally) changes the state of the software system.
  #
  # An operation is basically an object that respond to `call`, but that
  # executes within a given world (see `bind`). It also has before and
  # after hooks that allows specifying what needs to be done before invoking
  # call and after having invoked it. All this protocol is actually under
  # the responsibility of an `OperationRunner`. Operations should not be
  # called manually by third-party code.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     class SayHello < Startback::Operation
  #
  #       before_call do
  #         # e.g. check_some_permissions
  #       end
  #
  #       def call
  #         puts "Hello"
  #       end
  #
  #       after_call do
  #         # e.g. log and/or emit something on a bus
  #       end
  #
  #     end
  #
